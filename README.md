## ðŸ“š About Me

I'm a final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, I am passionate about the field of Analog and Mixed-Signal Design.My journey through various academic projects, internships, and leadership roles has strengthened my technical foundation and problem-solving skills in areas like PLL design, IC fabrication, and hardware interfacing using FPGA.

I am particularly skilled in tools such as Cadence Virtuoso, LTSpice, and Xilinx Vivado, which Iâ€™ve used in projects ranging from designing clock generation systems for SerDes to developing flight controllers for drones. Iâ€™m eager to apply my knowledge and passion in the semiconductor industry, with a long-term goal of advancing Indiaâ€™s role in analog and mixed-signal technology.
